Active3D Desktop Pipeline
===

Built with OpenCV and GLUT.

Image -> Segment foreground/background -> 3D reconstruction -> Stereo view -> Active 3D

Takes a 2D image and performs a user assisted GrabCut segmantation. The two segmented images (foreground and background) are reconstructed in 3D and rendered from different perspectives to generate a stereo pair for side by side 3D viewing.
